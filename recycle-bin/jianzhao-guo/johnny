        <h1>Love the way you lie</h1>
        <h2>Eminem</h2>
            <p>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn<br>But that's alright because I like the way it hurts<br>Just gonna stand there and hear me cry<br>But that's alright because I love the way you lie<br>I love the way you lie<br>I can't tell you what it really is<br>I can only tell you what it feels like<br>And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe<br></p>
            <p>I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight<br>As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight<br>High off her love, drunk from her hate,<br>It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate<br>And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me<br>She fucking hates me and I love it.<br>"Wait! Where you going?"<br>"I'm leaving you!"
                <br></p>
            <p>"No you ain't. Come back."<br>We're running right back.<br>Here we go again<br>It's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great<br>I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane<br></p>
            <p>But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped<br>Who's that dude?<br>"I don't even know his name."<br>I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again<br>I guess I don't know my own strength<br>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn<br>But that's alright because I like the way it hurts<br>Just gonna stand there and hear me cry<br></p>
            <p>But that's alright because I love the way you lie<br>I love the way you lie<br>I love the way you lie<br></p>
